# üßê Project philosophy

- DeFi Signal is my second capstone project for the Software Engineering career track offered through Springboard. This application is designed to show users the basics of decentralized finance by pulling information from multiple external apis and displaying it in a clean UI built with React.js 

- This repository holds the code for the back-end built with Node and Express. User authorization and authentication are handled here as well as multiple requests to external API's to obtain real time data. An object oriented design has been used to organize code and allow for reusable methods. A RESTful design has been used for all routes.

# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the app uses:

- This project uses the React.js library along with chart.js and react-router on the front-end. The back-end uses Node and Express. The repo for the back-end can be found here [DeFi-Signal-Backend](https://github.com/Alex-Reitz/DeFi-Signal-Backend)
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
